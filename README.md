# Get Started
We've included several Jupyter Notebooks to help you get started using the Python SDK for the IBM Functional Genomics Platform (formerly named OMXWare).  

**Note:** the package name has not changed so we can maintain backwards compatibility and minimize code breakage

Feel free to clone / fork the repo and get started! Let us know, if you have any questions.
